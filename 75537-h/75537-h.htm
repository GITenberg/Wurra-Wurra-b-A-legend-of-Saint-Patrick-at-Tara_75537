<p class="dropcap">’Twas in the days whin the good
Patrick of Armagh slept with
wan eye open, owin’ to the murderous
desire of a bunch of haythin
magicians to hang onto
their jobs at the court of King
Laeghaire. There was the
chief royal wizard, Lochru by
name, an’ two other divil-sint
Druid priests, namely Caplait
an’ Lucat-Moel, who hild the
graft of makin’ wise haythins
of Ethne the Fair an’ Fedelm
the Ruddy, the King’s two
daughters an’ the twin apples
of his eye; an’ between the
three of thim, with the King lookin’ their
way wan day an’ Patrick’s way the next, the
spells of wind an’ water an’ black magic the
good Patrick had to circumvint were sure a
caution.</p>

</div>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span></p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="illus02" style="max-width: 31.25em;">

<figure class="figright illowp75" id="illus03" style="max-width: 9.375em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/illus03.jpg" alt="">
</figure>

<p>Now Patrick, bein’ a gintleman and the
guest of King Laeghaire at Tara, could not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
turn himself loose on mimbers
of the King’s own household.
All the same, if he was to clane
up Ireland, Druids, snakes an’
all, ’twas important to begin
by convertin’ the King. So he was goin’
easy like, wan day miltin’ Laeghaire to tears
with his iloquence, an’ alas! the nixt day
findin’ the King bowin’ down to the great
gold an’ silver idol, Cromm Cruach, which
stood on the plain near Tara surrounded by
twilve smaller idols of brass an’ tin. ’Twas<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
a case of Cromm Cruach against Patrick an’
the Four Gospils with the odds even.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="illus04" style="max-width: 31.25em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/illus04.jpg" alt="">

<figure class="figleft illowp75" id="illus05" style="max-width: 9.375em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/illus05.jpg" alt="">
</figure>

<p>Wan thing was plain, Cromm Cruach the
big idol, an’ all the little idols must go. So
wan day, in the prisence of King Laeghaire
an’ all his household an’ a great multitude
of the people, Patrick raised his staff before
Cromm Cruach, an’ in the twinklin’ of an
eye the big idol an’ all the little idols sank
into the plain up to their necks. ’Twas a
miracle the like of which had niver been
seen in Ireland. An’ King Laeghaire, seein’
that all the spells of his Druid magicians
could not raise up Cromm Cruach again,
nor even the smallest of the little idols, became
a Christian on the spot.</p>

<p>Observin’ the same, old Lochru the wizard
fell to ragin’ an’ tearin’ out his long whiskers<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
by handfuls. Caplait an’ Lucat-Moel were
frothin’ at the mouth because of their fat
jobs gone a-glimmerin’. ’Twas a great day
for the good Patrick, barrin’ the prisint
failure of the multitude to follow the example
of the King.</p>

  <img class="w100" src="images/illus06.jpg" alt="">
</figure>

<p>Instead of fallin’ on their knees to receive
the blissin’ of Patrick as he stood there with
Sechnall his bishop, Erc his judge, an’ Presbiter
Bescna his chaplain, all in their church
vestmints, the people turned their faces to
the West as wan man, beat upon their brists
an’ cried out: “O, Wurra-Wurra!” In their
mixture of ancient Irish an’ Gaelic (which
was the common speech in those days), three
times they cried: “O, Wurra-Wurra!” before
they would let Patrick bliss an’ disperse
thim.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span></p>

<p>Now there was in Patrick’s train Keth
Mac Maragh, his strong man, the same that
carried him on his back through the bogs
an’ was his champion whin it came to fightin’
barbarians who would not accept the Gospil
with whole heads. Keth was moreover a
bit of a shanachy, or story-teller, in his way,
with a head full of the old tales an’ histories
set down in the Book of the Dun Cow,
which made him the frind of ivery small
boy wheriver Patrick carried on the good<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
work. So whin he heard the multitude cry
out: “O, Wurra-Wurra!” at the downfall
of Cromm Cruach, Keth was disturbed in
his mind. Niver before had he heard those
words of lamentation uttered by a multitude
all in spontaneous accord. Yet in the
mouths of sorrowin’ girls forsaken by their
lovers, an’ old women at a wake or grievin’
over sheep with the foot-rot, they were
words as familiar in Patrick’s time as they
are to this day.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="illus07" style="max-width: 31.25em;">

<figure class="figright illowp65" id="illus09" style="max-width: 6.25em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/illus09.jpg" alt="">
</figure>

<p>But the thing that
most disturbed the
mind of Keth Mac
Maragh was the sight
of Finola of the White
Shoulder, wan of Patrick’s
three embroideresses—which
means a
Christian mimber of
Patrick’s own household—turnin’
her pretty
face to the West with
the multitude an’ joinin’
in the cry of “Wurra-Wurra!”
’Twas sure
a haythin act, an’ as
Keth had been for a
long time swate on this<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
same Finola, findin’ her white
shoulder a plisant place to rist his
head on, he wint speedily an’ taxed
her with it.</p>

<p>But Finola only hung her pretty
head an’ was silent.</p>

<figure class="figright illowp80" id="illus10" style="max-width: 9.375em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/illus10.jpg" alt="">
</figure>

<p>“Finola,” says Keth, “ye ought
to be ashamed of yoursilf, you a
mimber of the good Patrick’s
household an’ a ’broiderer of the
sacred vestmints.”</p>

<p>Niver a word answered Finola,
but only hung her head the lower.</p>

<p>Then said Keth Mac Maragh
with a keen look at the girl:</p>

<p>“Finola, ’tis yoursilf has told the
truth though not a word has passed
your lips. Cromm Cruach, which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
our good Patrick has overthrown,
was not the only
great false god in Ireland.”</p>

<div class="clearboth">

<figure class="figleft illowp22" id="illus11" style="max-width: 9.375em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/illus11.jpg" alt="">
</figure>

<figure class="figright illowp22" id="illus12" style="max-width: 9.375em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/illus12.jpg" alt="">
</figure>

<p>Now the girl appeared
startled, but her head still
drooped an’ she answered
neither yes nor no. With a
smile half hid by the hair on
his lip, Keth spoke sternly
to her:</p>

<p>“Finola, I have it from
your own lips that you came
to Patrick at Tara from your
people over in the West
country. ’Tis over in the
West stands another great
idol, an’ the name of it is
Wurra-Wurra.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span></p>

<p>At these words Finola
began trimbling violently,
though she spoke no word,
an’ her head still drooped.
Keth Mac Maragh showed
the girl no mercy.</p>

<p>“’Tis in my mind, Finola,”
he said, “to make
a journey over into the
West country, an’ find this
heathen god, Wurra-Wurra,
an’ cast him down even as
Patrick cast down Cromm
Cruach.”</p>

<p>Now the girl lifted her
head and spoke up quickly:
“But you are not in orders,
Keth, an’ have no Bishop’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>
staff to raise against this idol—if so there be
one.”</p>

</div>

<p>“’Tis true I have no Bishop’s staff,” said
he, “nor do I nade wan. I have me handstone.
I have me handstone, the same that
did for Macc Cairthinn, mind ye, Finola.
An’ ’tis in me mind that the handstone that
spilled the brains of the King’s strong man
is enough to bash the countenance of a
haythin idol.”</p>

<p>And he took the stone out of his shield to
gaze on its fine shape and feel the weight of it.
“’Twas a smaller wan,” he said, “a mere
stone from the brook with no virtue whativer,
that David sunk into the forehead of Goliath.”</p>

<p>“Is it the same,” whispered Finola with
awe in her eyes, “that gave ye the triumph
over Macc Cairthinn?”</p>

  <img class="w100" src="images/illus13.jpg" alt="">
</figure>

<p>“’Tis a better wan,” spoke up Keth Mac
Maragh proudly. “’Tis of fresh-slaked lime
mixed with those same brains of the King’s
strong man that I spilled with the old wan—mixed
with Macc Cairthinn’s own brains
an’ dried in the sun till it has the hardness
of flint an’ the toughness of oak. Besides—mark
this, Finola—’tis a true handstone with
all the virtues of me own Red Branch Knighthood.
An’ who can throw it fairer or
swifter than Keth Mac Maragh?”</p>

<p>At these words Finola turned strangely
pale. Prisently she threw her arms about
the neck of Keth an’ besought him not to
journey off into that wild West country.</p>

<p>“Keth, darlin’,” said she, “’tis the country
of the Badb an’ all the Dedannan furies,
where the terrible Banshees are only the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
least of the bad fairies. They
will have your body an’ your
soul.” An’ then she whispered:</p>

<figure class="figright illowp50" id="illus15" style="max-width: 6.25em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/illus15.jpg" alt="">

<p>“Stay with Finola. She nades
ye, an’—an’ soon she’ll nade ye
sore!”</p>

<p>Now Keth was touched with the tears of
Finola, but he was an obstinate man an’ his
mind was made up to have it for his own
great triumph and credit with Patrick, the
castin’ down of Wurra-Wurra.
’Twas true also
that he had become a trifle
weary of the white arms of
Finola forever draggin’
about his neck. So he
threw them off gintly,
lavin’ her there on the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
ground half dead with grievin’,
an’ wint straight to Patrick for
lave to go on a journey on business
of his own.</p>

<figure class="figright illowp54" id="illus16" style="max-width: 12.5em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/illus16.jpg" alt="">
</figure>

<p>The good Patrick, bein’ easy in
his mind an’ cheerful now that Cromm
Cruach was done for, gave Keth his lave
an’ a blissin’; an’ lest Finola’s arms should
drag at his neck again, he did not delay,
but took his shield an’ his handstone an’
was off on his long legs
for the West country.</p>

<figure class="figleft illowp30" id="illus17" style="max-width: 12.5em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/illus17.jpg" alt="">

<p>Indade, ’twas well he
did not loiter, for the old
wizard Lochru had already
got wind of his interprise
an’ was brewin’ his most
divilish spells against him.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
Caplait was in the same
business. ’Twas a close
call for Keth Mac
Maragh, for between
thim these two howlin’
old wizards bossed all
the bad fairies an’ demons
an’ reptiles in
Ireland.</p>

<p>All this, mind ye, was
before Patrick had got
ready to attind to the
snakes. The land was
full of thim. As for
fairies, good an’ bad,
at the time whin the
good Patrick landed at
Wicklow they were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
thicker than the people—which is worth
raymimberin’, for there were tin times as
many Irishmin in Ireland then than iver has
been since. In those days ’twas a case of
Ireland for the Irish, with the rist of the
world lookin’ on in envy an’ covetousness,
but takin’ care to kape their hands off to
save their heads.</p>

<p>There was no nade for Keth to carry meat
or drink—which was another fine thing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>
about Ireland in those days. At ivery crossroads
was an inn maintained at the public
expinse, for the intertainmint of travellers
without money an’ without price, an’ the
pot always a-bilin’ day an’ night. ’Twas the
shanachies an’ poets who travelled about
thicker than thieves, singin’ their songs an’
tellin’ their tales at the courts of the kings,
that were the cause of all this hospitality, for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
these gentry put on even more airs in those
days than they do now, havin’ free graft
iverywhere, so eager were the people to hear
all the news an’ the romances.</p>

<p class="tb">’Tis already towld how Keth was a bit of
a shanachy himsilf, an’ well versed in all the
wizardry of Patrick’s Druid inemies. ’Twas
a full grown man’s job, by this token, that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
old Lochru took on himsilf
in layin’ his plans to save
Wurra-Wurra from the
vi’lint hands of Patrick’s
strong man. An’ ’twill iver
be to the credit of Lochru’s
divilish subtlety that he so
near finished for poor Keth
by transformin’ himsilf into
a false shanachy an’ tacklin’
the lad on his soft side.</p>

<p>Through County Armagh
an’ well into Fermanagh
Keth Mac Maragh passed
safely, livin’ free on the fat
of the land an’ kapin’ an
eye opin for signs of the old
idol Wurra-Wurra. ’Tis<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span>
true that wance Lochru tried to beguile him
with a venomous banshee in the guise of a
beautiful maiden all smiles an improper alluremints;
but Finola’s white shoulder was
still so fresh in his mind that he only
laughed an’ bid her the time of day an’
passed on his way.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="illus22" style="max-width: 31.25em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/illus22.jpg" alt="">
</figure>

<p>Wance, too, Lochru sint a swarm of
sheevras—which are the most impish of all
the bad fairies—with orders
to choke Keth to death on
salmon bones as he ate his
avenin’ meal; but ’twas all in
vain, for Keth was wise an’
kept his fingers crossed.</p>

<p>Havin’ seen the failure of
these poor experimints,
Lochru changed his face out<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
of all raysimblance to himsilf,
an’ took a small Irish
harp an’ wint an’ sat on a
hillside among the shamrocks
close beside the broad
road along which he knew
Keth was soon to pass.
This was his preparation for
the grand schame that was
to hocus-pocus the idol-hunting
strong man for good
an’ all.</p>

<p>Prisintly, as Keth Mac
Maragh hove in sight, all
tired and dusty from a hard
day of travel, Lochru, in his
guise of an old an’ decrepit
shanachy, twanged the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
strings of his harp an’ began to sing of past
glories whin he was royal shanachy at Tara
with four an’ twinty pupils all sheddin’ lustre
on his performance. But whin Keth came
abrist of him on the road he lifted his voice
in a sort of refrain, the substince of which
caused Patrick’s strong man to prick up his
ears an’ pinch himsilf to be sure he was
indade awake. For this was the unexpicted
purport of Lochru’s refrain:</p>

</figure>

<p>An’ no sooner had the schamin’ Lochru
in his disguise exprissed these fine Christian
sintimints than Keth fell for him. Yis,
Keth Mac Maragh fell for him complately—swallowin’
bait, hook, line an’ all.</p>

<p>Old Lochru, pretindin’ not to observe the
prisince of the lad, was about to reel off a
few more yards of his song, but Keth fell
on his neck, sayin’:</p>

<p>“Hiven’s blessin’s rist on ye, old man;
for ’tis indade true, as ye’ve said, that
Wurra-Wurra’s fatal hour has struck.
Tell me where to look for the owld idol
that I may bash his face with me handstone.”</p>

<p>“Do me eyes desayve me?” said the false
shanachy, returnin’ Keth’s embrace. “No;
sure ’tis the good Patrick’s strong man that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span>
stands before me—Keth Mac Maragh, who,
wan day, will be a bishop.”</p>

<p>“’Tis the same,” said Keth, swellin’ with
pride at the wizard’s prophecy—for that was
Keth’s great saycrit ambition, to become a
bishop. An’ now Lochru had him hard an’
fast. No suspicion of the false shanachy could
have been beaten into his head with an axe.</p>

<p>“But the time passes,” said Keth; “show
me the road to Wurra-Wurra, that I may
speedily earn me bishop’s staff.”</p>

<p>Lochru was playin’ with the lad as a cat
plays with a mouse. “Have ye no fear of the
druid wizards?” he said. “Can ye circumvint
the spells of Lochru? Are ye after thinkin’
that Lucat-Moel an’ Caplait will let ye come
at Wurra-Wurra to do the idol harm?”</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="illus26" style="max-width: 12.5em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/illus26.jpg" alt="">
</figure>

<p>“Divil take the wizards an’ all their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
spells,” answered Keth. “Sure, ’tis Keth
Mac Maragh, champion strong man an’ as
good a scholar as the bist of thim, that has
all their spells at his finger-ends. So set me
on the road to Wurra-Wurra.”</p>

<p>“Be it so,” said Lochru. “I persayve that
ye’re already a bishop, savin’ the ordination.
’Tis well. Give heed to me words, for ’tis
growin’ dark an’ ye must travil the night
through to escape the sure destruction which
Lochru has prepared for ye.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span></p>

<p>“Priss on your prisint way,
lad, till ye’ve rached the top
of the third wooded ridge.
There ye’ll see below ye in
the moonlight the glimmerin’
surface of a great bog, an’
on the farther side of the
same an owld round tower to
the right, an’ Concobar Mac
Nessa’s ruined castle to the
lift. Go straight down to the
edge of the bog an’ suddenly
ye’ll see that a fine, hard road
leads across it. Cross the
bog without fear. ’Tis a
short cut to Wurra-Wurra
over beyond the round tower,
an’ ’twill lave ye safe from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>
Lochru an’ all his demon immissaries.
Have ye me directions fixed clear in your
mind, lad?”</p>

<figure class="figleft illowp22" id="illus28" style="max-width: 9.375em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/illus28.jpg" alt="">
</figure>

<p>“Yis,” said Keth. “An’ may the blissin’s
of Patrick an’ all the saints rest on your
white head, vinerable owld man, for, thanks
to you, Wurra-Wurra is already as good as
done for.”</p>

<p>The nixt minute Keth’s legs were leadin’
him straight into the trap so cunningly set
for him, an’ old Lochru, raysumin’ his own
face an’ form, was chucklin’ into his long
whiskers.</p>

<p class="tb">Now whin Keth came to the top of the
third ridge an’ looked down upon the great
bog, ’twas the darkest hour of the night,
whin the bad fairies are up to their worst<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span>
divilmint, an’ the dangerous elves an’ demons
attind to the summons of their masters, the
Druid wizards. From the top of the ridge
there was no sign of any road across the
bog; but Keth, full of foolish faith in the
words of the false shanachy, stopped only to
draw a full breath, an’ was off down the
slope at his top speed.</p>

<p>An’ sure enough, as he neared the bog’s
edge, he saw before him a straight, hard
road gleamin’ in the moonlight an’ stretchin’
clear an’ fair to the hill-slope on the farther
side. With a shout of triumph, Keth laped
forward an’ ran swiftly out upon the road
over the bog. An’ thin, all at wance, there
was no more road, an’ he found himsilf
flounderin’ up to his arm-pits in the quaking
mud of the stickiest bog in Ireland.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span></p>

<p>An’ while he floundered he heard a peal
of faymiliar, divilish laughter from the bog’s
edge. There stood old Lochru, holdin’ his
sides an’ waggin’ his head—an’ thin, in a
flash, Keth saw it all, how he had been
hocus-pocussed by a false shanachy who was
none other than Lochru himsilf.</p>

<p>’Twas useless to waste breath lamintin’,
or hurlin’ hard names at Lochru; Keth saw
that he had nade of it all to extricate himsilf
from the bog—which he would have done
right speedily but for the trump card the old
wizard played thin an’ there.</p>

<p>All at wance Keth found himsilf surrounded
by a swarm of meisi—which are the
most dreadful phantoms that inhabit the
World of Darkness—summoned by the incantations
of Lochru. The sight of thim<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span>
froze Keth’s blood in his veins. For a time,
so full of terror they filled him, he could
nayther speak nor move. Manewhile, ivery
minute the bog sucked him down deeper.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p><i>Keth Mac Maragh in the bog, beset
  by the wizard spells of Lochru</i></p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Sure it would have been all over with
Keth Mac Maragh if, suddenly, there had
not appeared before him a vision of Patrick,
fearless in his great faith, casting down
Cromm Cruach in the very prisince of King
Laeghaire an’ the most powerful of the Druid
wizards. The vision gave him strength to
raise his voice to the glory of God an’ defiance
of the divil, so that he no longer
quaked with paralizin’ fear of the phantoms,
an’ was near strugglin’ out of the bog.</p>

<p>Thin it was that Lochru summoned
Banba, queen of the Dedannan furies, an’
with her diabolical aid caused Keth to be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
set upon by sheevras, leprechauns an’ all
manner of demoniac reptiles. All the bog
about him was covered with thim, an’ all the
air murmured and shrieked with the flapping
of demon wings. Pookas came and sat
upon his shoulders to priss him down into
the mire, while the dread Badb, in the guise
of a loathsome hag with the wings of a great
bat, shut the air from his nostrils and clawed
at his throat.</p>

<p>Yet always, at what seemed the fatal momint,
the voice of Keth, raised in praise of
God an’ bowld defiance of the divil, so
weakened the demoniac powers that old
Lochru, raging in vain, saw the dawn approaching
an’ his triumph unaccomplished.</p>

<p>Indade, the triumph was Keth’s, for, by
the blissin’ of heaven, he hild out. In fear<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span>
of the blastin’ rays of the sun, all at wance
his demon inemies disappeared with shrieks
of baffled vengeance, an’ old Lochru with
thim. An’ soon Keth, still praisin’ God an’
defyin’ the divil, was out of the bog an’
dryin’ himsilf in the sun.</p>

<p class="tb">Whin he was dry an’ somewhat risted an’
raycuperated after the long agonies of that
night, he retraced his steps to the road
where Lochru had beguiled him. Wan day
an’ a night he spint at an inn for food an’
slape, while the maids claned the bog slime
from his raimint, an’ thin proceeded on his
way into the West.</p>

<p>Not until he was out of Fermanagh an’
well into Roscommon did he come upon
any clue to the whereabouts of Wurra-Wurra.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>
’Twas truly strange that the right direction
should come from another shanachy—but a
rale wan this time, none other than the great
Dubthach Mac na Lugair, royal poet at the
court of the King of Connaught.</p>

<p>Keth came upon Dubthach as the renowned
shanachy was fastin’ on a false poet
who owed him a debt for makin’ up some
rhymes which the false poet recited about
the country as his own divine afflatus. This
fakir was a failure at bog-drainin’ named
Fergus, an’ havin’ neglected to pay for the
rhymes he couldn’t make up for himself he
was shut up in his house while Dubthach
sat before his door, neither of thim eatin’
nor drinkin’, as the custom was, till the
matter was settled. Dubthach was so pale
an’ lean from four days an’ nights of fastin’<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>
that his tunic was all in wrinkles
about his shoulders. Fergus’
plight was worse yet, for as he
sat by his open window with
his head in his hand he seemed only half
alive. Still ivery time Dubthach braced up
an’ called on him to pay the debt he came
back with a sharp answer.</p>

<figure class="figright illowp100" id="illus29" style="max-width: 9.375em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/illus29.jpg" alt="">
</figure>

<p>“’Tis four geese an’ a sheep ye owe me,”
said Dubthach, as Keth came up.</p>

<p>“Ye’re a liar. ’Tis three geese an’ a pig,”
said Fergus.</p>

<p>“The law is with me, I’ll starve the heart
out of ye,” said Dubthach.</p>

<p>“Yer rhymes were no good, they stuck in
me throat,” said Fergus. “But I’ll pay ye
the three geese an’ the pig—or see yer bones
litterin’ me doorstep.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span></p>

<p>Right here Keth stepped in, havin’ great
wisdom in such matters. After hearin’ both
sides he recited to ’em the Brehon law, an’
then he said:</p>

<p>“The both of ye are in the wrong. Fergus,
what ye owe to Dubthach is not four
geese an’ a sheep, but four geese an’ a pig.”</p>

<p>Hearin’ this wise judgmint, Dubthach an’
Fergus scowled fiercely at each other; but
’twas plain their jaws were achin’ to come
together on a flitch o’ bacon, an’ so Dubthach
spoke up:</p>

<p>“Niver shall it be told of me,” he said,
“that I refused to mate an inemy half way.
Fergus, ye omadhune, open the door of
your hovel an’ let out the four geese an’ the
pig.”</p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p><i>Keth recites the Brehon Law to Dubthach

</figure>

<p>Which the same Fergus did, with a string<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span>
tied to the leg of each of ’em for Dubthach
to drive ’em home with. An’ Dubthach,
with the pig an’ the four geese safe in hand,
turned an’ howled back at Fergus:</p>

<p>“As I’m lavin’ your dirty doorstep, ye
double-faced falsifier, wan word of advice:
Lave off graftin’ on your betters an’ get
back to your bog-drainin’.” To Keth Mac
Maragh who walked beside him he said:</p>

<p>“Niver mintion it to Fergus, but ye’ve
done me a service this day. Faith, I was
that far gone with the fast I could feel
me backbone through me stomach! An’
now me good frind tell me how I can
square the account between the two of us.
Will ye take two geese, or the pig?”</p>

  <img class="w100" src="images/illus30.jpg" alt="">

<p>Now, bein’ well on into the West country,
with maybe the great god Wurra-Wurra just<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span>
around the turn of the nixt peat bog, Keth
felt it was a time to exercise discretion, for
the lad was as wise an’ cunning as he was
strong an’ mighty at heavin’ the handstone.
So he reflected and made this answer to
Dubthach:</p>

<p>“Dubthach Mac na Lugair,” he said, “the
service ye say I’ve the honor of renderin’ ye
was no more than would be the duty of any
man who knew the law. Ye owe me nothin’.
But ’tis in me mind that ye could give me a
bit of advice on a private matter, an’ let it
go no further?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span></p>

<figure class="figright illowp22" id="illus31" style="max-width: 9.375em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/illus31.jpg" alt="">
</figure>

<p>“On me honor as a royal shanachy,”
said Dubthach. “Good
frind, name your trouble.”</p>

<p>“Dubthach,” said Keth, with
his hand beside his mouth an’ his
mouth to the poet’s ear, “Dubthach,
I’ve a great weight on me
mind an’ me heart. The heft of
it is draggin’ me down in the dirt.
Night an’ day I’m sorrowin’ an’
grievin’ the heart out of me. ’Tis
turnin’ me hair an’ loosenin’ me
teeth. It turns me food bitter in
me mouth an’ the best metheglin
sour in me throat. I can nayther
slape nor stay awake. Unless I
find relafe, in another day the
wits will be clane gone out of me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span></p>

<p>“Iverything I’ve tried, an’ no use at all at
all. Sure I’ve been atin’ the cresses an’
drinkin’ the crazy people’s water of Tobernagalt
an’ Stroove Bran, but divil the bit of
forgetfulness of me trouble did it bring me.
Wan more day, good Dubthach, an’ I’ll be
a foolish, ravin’ loon with all this sore grafe
an’ worry”—</p>

<figure class="figleft illowp22" id="illus32" style="max-width: 9.375em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/illus32.jpg" alt="">

<p>“Hold, me frind, ’tis enough,” broke in
Dubthach. “An’ ye’ve struck the right road
at last. By nightfall ye’ll rache the nixt
valley. ’Tis called Glanngalt, mind ye
(manin’ in the Gaelic the glen of the galts,
or loonatics), an’ at the bottom of the same
ye’ll come to the grotto of Wurra-Wurra,
our blissed God of Peaceful Souls. Ye’ve
only to make the three prostrations an’
whisper your troubles into the blissed ear of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span>
Wurra-Wurra an’ they’ll all fall
from ye, lavin’ ye clane an’
paceful an’ in your right
mind.”</p>

<p>At these words Keth fell on
his knees an’ kissed the hand
of Dubthach that was not busy
with the geese an’ the pig,
showin’ the joy an’ gratitude
he sacretly felt for bein’ put
on the right track to come up
with an’ bash the face of this
haythin idol Wurra-Wurra.
Then he rose an’ said:</p>

<p>“Wan thing more, good
Dubthach. Will ye find me a
guide down Glanngalt to the
grotto of Wurra-Wurra?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span></p>

<p>“Ye’ll find a hundred of your own choice,”
said Dubthach. “Ye’ve only to enter the
valley an’ goin’ down on wan side ye’ll see
a string of wild-eyed, sorrowin’ loonatics
like yersilf—which ye’ve but to join—an’
comin’ up on the other side ye’ll see another
string dancin’ an’ singin’ with joy because
of the worries they lift in the grotto behind
thim. Stick to the loonatics goin’ down,
an’ on the word of Dubthach ye’ll come
back dancin’ an’ singin’ with the happy wans.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span></p>

<p>So now Keth Mac Maragh fell on the
neck of Dubthach Mac na Lugair an’ embraced
him, an’ thin wint on his way at so
swift a gait that the early avenin’ brought
him safe into Glanngalt. ’Twas as Dubthach
had said: there was the string of
sorrowin’ min and women goin’ down on
the wan side an’ the happy dancin’ people
comin’ up on the other. An’ Keth wint
with the loonatics, an’ by dark they came to
the grotto of Wurra-Wurra that was to be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span>
seen from afar by the light of torches that
flamed all about it.</p>

<p>Sure it was a grand sight—barrin’ the haythin
purpose of it all. The poor loonatics
stopped their screechin’ from the moment
the torches revealed to thim the smilin’ face
of the idol, which shone from out the arch
of the grotto entrance like the moon whin
’tis full at harvest time. An’ prisintly the
first of the loonatics to prostrate thimsilves
at the feet of Wurra-Wurra were passin’<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span>
over to the other side, singin’ an’ dancin’,
with niver a fear nor a care to worry thim.</p>

<p>Before dawn ’twas the same with the
whole bunch. With the cobwebs brushed
clane out of the brains of thim, they were
on their way rejoicin’, lavin’ Keth Mac
Maragh alone before the idol, fingerin’ his
handstone an’ wonderin’ what manner of
spell was on him.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="illus37" style="max-width: 31.25em;">

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="illus38" style="max-width: 12.5em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/illus38.jpg" alt="">
</figure>

<p>For three times Keth had raised his hand
to hurl the stone, and could not. The spirit<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span>
was with him, but the flesh was not. The
strength had gone out of his arm intirely,
an’ the fingers that held the handstone had
no more grip in thim than the little white
wans of Finola.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="illus39" style="max-width: 12.5em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/illus39.jpg" alt="">
</figure>

<p>“’Tis Lucat-Moel, or old Lochru, divil
take him!” said Keth to himself.</p>

<p>He gazed about in ivery direction, but
niver a wizard nor any of their bad fairy
hilpers was about the premises. Yet the
arm that hild the handstone still hung limp
at his side, an’ his trimblin’ fingers could
scarce bear the weight of it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span></p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="illus40" style="max-width: 31.25em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/illus40.jpg" alt="">
</figure>

<p>Now it began to pinetrate the mind of
Keth Mac Maragh that while his arm was
as heavy as lead, the soul within him was
lighter than for many a day. A horrible
fear rose within him that the Four Gospils
had lost their grip on him, an’ it was the same
with him as with the rist of the loonatics!
With the sweat standin’ on his brow, he
said a Latin prayer, an’ thin muttered to
himsilf:</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="illus41" style="max-width: 12.5em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/illus41.jpg" alt="">
</figure>

<p>“I will put a curse on the haythin idol.
I will curse this Wurra-Wurra as niver haythin
idol was cursed before, so that his face<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>
will grow dull with fear an’ the strength return
to me arm.”</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="illus42" style="max-width: 15.625em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/illus42.jpg" alt="">
</figure>

<p>An’ he turned to curse Wurra-Wurra.
’Twas now, for the first time, he saw the
opin ears of the idol that listened day an’
night for the gintlist whisper of troubles of
man or woman, to take the same on himsilf—an’
thin Keth filt the full power of him.
The curse died on his lips, all desire of
curses wint out of his heart. Keth Mac
Maragh, Strong Man to the good Patrick
that was to become a blissed saint, leaned
upon his shield an’ gazed long on the image<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span>
that filled the grotto. An’ while he gazed
the soul of him drank its fill of peace and
forgetfulness of care.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="illus43" style="max-width: 31.25em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/illus43.jpg" alt="">
</figure>

<p>For it was true of the ancient Irish God
of Peaceful Souls, named Wurra-Wurra, that
no creature of woman born could stand before
him an’ know more of trouble in this
world. From ivery shoulder he took off the
trouble to place it upon its own, and bear it
thinceforth in token of his great love and
compassion for all with minds distrissed.
There was no nade for Keth to read the inscription
on the stone which was the idol’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span>
seat—which, indade, he could not, for it was
in the most ancient Irish characters. ’Twas
Bishop Erc, the same who was Judge in
Patrick’s household and a very learned man,
who afterward put it into Gaelic, which,
being translated into English, is the best of
all mottoes in the category, namely:</p>

<p class="center allsmcap">LET WURRA WORRY</p>

<p>There was no nade for Keth Mac Maragh
to read this inscription, for the face and
figure of the idol, an’ his wide opin ears
foriver listenin’, thimselves told the whole
story—not only that it was his business to
bear all the worries and troubles of the
world, but that he liked the job!</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="illus44" style="max-width: 15.625em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/illus44.jpg" alt="">
</figure>

<p>Indade, yis. Though the weight of the
world’s worries through a hundred cinturies
had glued the stomach of him to his thighs,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span>
an’ his broad chist risted on his stomach so
that the massy shoulders were prissed nearly
down to the region of his navel, while the
heft of the troubles showered on his head
had crunched it down into his bristbone—in
spite of all the crushing weight of worries
upon him the smile he wore was like the
noon sun bursting through after a tin days’
rain in April. ’Twas that same smile of
Wurra-Wurra that chased away all the curses
out of the heart of Keth Mac Maragh an’<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span>
brought the great peace to
his soul.</p>

<p>Alas! as Keth looked upon
the idol, Patrick an’ all his glorious
works became no more
than a faded memory. He
filt himself ready to prostrate
himsilf before Wurra-Wurra
an’ whisper into the ear of him
his last small worry about Finola
of the White Shoulder—upon
which he had risted his
head more ardently than was
good for his ease of mind—whin
a well-raymimbered an’
hated voice brought him suddenly
to himsilf.</p>

<p>“Back, thou sacriligious<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span>
monster!” said the voice, an’
Keth knew it for the voice
of Lochru, the wizard.</p>

<p>Indade, the wizard, prancin’
down the hillside into the
valley, frothin’ at the mouth
an’ all his whiskers flyin’ in
the mornin’ breeze, was only
a lape or two from the mouth
of the grotto.</p>

<p>“Back!” he shrieked.
“Back! or I’ll blast ye with
the spell of Banba!”</p>

<p>’Twas nothing against Keth
Mac Maragh that in his surprise
he should stand back a
few paces and raise his shield,
for old Lochru in a rage was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span>
a sight to sind children into spasms. ’Twas
a good thing, too, for the hated sight of
Lochru brought back the grateful mimory
of Patrick, an’ the strength to his arm, so
that he faced the wizard boldly, saying:</p>

<p>“Get thee gone thou Geis of demon’s
spawn, ere I spill thy rotten brains to gain a
new handstone wherewith to destroy thy
demon masters! Irk me not, as I have
better work at hand than to bandy words
with such as thou!”</p>

  <img class="w100" src="images/illus48.jpg" alt="">

<p>An’ raisin’ his handstone while the
strength was fresh again in his arm, Keth
Mac Maragh hurled it so swift and so
straight that the idol’s face—barrin’ only wan
fine ear—was shattered into a thousand
pieces. An’ Lochru, seeing that Wurra-Wurra
was no more—a headless god havin’<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span>
no further virtue in the Druid philosophy—Lochru
ran shriekin’ up the valley, to remain
until his death the craziest loonatic in Ireland.</p>

<p class="tb">“’Tis a fine job well done,” raymarked
Keth to himsilf as he wint and raycovered
his handstone in the grotto from among the
fragmints that were wance the head of
Wurra-Wurra. “An’ now for a bit of sup
an’ drink, an’ a fine long slape.”</p>

<p>But ’twas nayther food nor
drink nor slape Keth Mac
Maragh was to get that day.
For he had returned on his way up Glanngalt
no more than the distance of nine
ridges whin he was stopped by a runner
comin’ down the valley with the speed of
the wind. The boy bein’ breathless, Keth
was the first to spake:</p>

<p>“If ’tis to the King of
Connaught ye bear your
message,” he said, “sure ye’re
off your road.”</p>

  <img class="w100" src="images/illus51.jpg" alt="">

<p>“Keth Mac Maragh,”
panted the runner—who was
lithe an’ slender, with round
cheeks an’ a white chin—“has
the day come so soon<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span>
whin ye forgit the face of your
own Finola?”</p>

<figure class="figright illowp18" id="illus52" style="max-width: 7.8125em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/illus52.jpg" alt="">
</figure>

<p>“What!” said Keth in astonishment,
“will ye tell me that
your haythin heresies have so
strong a howld on ye that ye’ve
lift the household an’ spiritual
guidance of the good Patrick
of Armagh?”</p>

<p>“Nay,” said Finola. “’Tis
for Patrick sure I’m runnin’, an’
the message is to yoursilf.”</p>

<p>“So! ’Twas the likes of Finola
that gave me away!” And
Keth glowered darkly at the
maid.</p>

<p>“Tell me, Keth,” she said
in anxious tones, “ye’ve not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span>
done it? Ye’ve not bashed the
great idol, Wurra-Wurra?”</p>

<figure class="figleft illowp75" id="illus53" style="max-width: 9.375em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/illus53.jpg" alt="">

<p>Somethin’ towld Keth that
’twould be as well for him to
dissimble. So he answered
cunningly:</p>

<p>“Sure the pot-bellied stone haythin sits as
firm on his sate as iver he did.”</p>

<p>“O Wurra-Wurra!” said Finola, with
hands clasped in gratitude.</p>

<p>“Lave off your heretical supplications,”
said Keth harshly, “an’ hand over me missage
from Patrick.”</p>

<p>“’Tis this,” said Finola, givin’ him a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span>
tinder look from her eyes.
“Another bunch of poor loonatics
have started down Glanngalt
to lave their troubles with
Wurra-Wurra. Patrick follows
with his household, but too late to heal thim
with the spirit of the Four Gospils before
they feel the spell of the sacred grotto. So
ye’re to let thim, for this wance, resayve
their easemint from Wurra-Wurra, as of
old—for sure, Patrick says, the great idol is
an instrumint of God, not yet to be destroyed.”</p>

<p>“So be it,” said Keth, dissimbling again.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span>
“Go you back to Patrick an’
I will wait for ye beside the
grotto.”</p>

<p>Finola flung hersilf upon
his neck. “’Tis like the owld
swate Keth,” she said. “Ah,
Keth, why are ye not always
true to the gintleness an’ hilpfulness
that shines in your
face so like Wurra-Wurra’s
own?”</p>

<p class="tb">Thin she kissed him and
lift him, an’ Keth wint slowly
back to the grotto, with his
chin on his brist, wonderin’
how he was to restore the
idol’s broken head on his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span>
shoulders. He gathered up
the pieces an’ mixed some
clay an’ tried to patch thim
together, but ’twas no use—too
well had the handstone
done its work!</p>

<p>An’ now Keth could hear
the fresh bunch of loonatics
comin’ shriekin’ an’ moanin’
down the valley. ’Twas even
a worse predicamint he was
in, for, crowdin’ the loonatics
on all sides were scores an’
hundreds of maids weepin’
for their gallivantin’ swatehearts,
an’ old dames lamintin’
sheep with the foot
rot, cows with calves miscast<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span>
an’ such like troubles which ’twas in the
minds of thim to shoulder off on Wurra-Wurra.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="illus59" style="max-width: 31.25em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/illus59.jpg" alt="">
</figure>

<p>“Sure, ’tis a tight place I’m in,” thought
Keth Mac Maragh. “The loonatics, an’
the maids, an’ the old women will be after
bashin’ the head of me as I bashed their
haythin idol. True, I have me handstone,
but what is wan handstone for all that crazy
bunch?”</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="illus60" style="max-width: 31.25em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/illus60.jpg" alt="">

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="illus61" style="max-width: 31.25em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/illus61.jpg" alt="">
</figure>

<p>An’ then suddenly it flashed across his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span>
mind about what Finola had said of his face
raysimblin’ that of Wurra-Wurra. “Sure,
’tis only the fondness of her foolish little
haythin heart,” thought Keth. But as ’twas
the only chance, an’ the first of the loonatics
bein’ now close to the grotto, Keth Mac
Maragh wint behind the headless idol an’
leaned over with his neck in the hollow between
the shoulders which the handstone
had cut as though through a bog-cured
cheese. He brought his chin down near to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span>
the idol’s navel, prissed the cheek of him
against the opin ear that remained so providentially,
hid his arms an’ body behind the
great bulk of the image—an’ thin upon the
face of him he spread the gintlest and tinderest
smile that was in him.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="illus62" style="max-width: 12.5em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/illus62.jpg" alt="">
</figure>

<p>Sure it was all the same to the loonatics.
Indade, it seemed an improvement. For,
no sooner did a daft wan catch the twinkle
in Keth’s eye than the twisted brains of him<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span>
were all straightened out an’ he passed on
rejoicin’. As the last of the crazy wans
were droppin’ their troubles on Wurra-Wurra,
Keth saw that Patrick an’ his followers
had rached the bottom of the valley,
where the blissed saint that was to be, surrounded
by his bishops and his priests and
his psalmists, all in their vestmints, was
prachin’ the Gospil an’ making converts of
iverybody.</p>

  <img class="w100" src="images/illus65.jpg" alt="">

<p>All the while Keth grew bolder with his
smile an’ the twinkle in his eye. Whin it
came to the turn of the old dames with their
cow-yard troubles, siveral times he forgot
himsilf so far as to smile aloud. Indade,
more than wan full-stomached guffaw did he
give in the face of thim, an’ got away with
it, so rayjoiced they were with the lightness
of heart that Wurra-Wurra gave thim.</p>

<p>Whin it came to the sorrowin’ maids with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span>
their sad tales on their swatehearts, beyond
a wink or two at the prettiest Keth was
moved to restrain himsilf. For sure, many
were the pitiful tales of loving maids’
troubles they poured in his ear! Tales they
were that made his heart sore, an’ disturbed
his mind with recollictions of strange words
lately dropped by Finola of the White
Shoulder. ’Twas this new light on those
same words that now caused Keth Mac<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span>
Maragh to forget for a momint
the smile of Wurra-Wurra,
an’ to close his eyes
with the pain of the thought
that came to him.</p>

<p class="tb">An’ whin Keth opened his
eyes the last of the maids was
prostrated before him—an’
she was Finola! Quickly—though
his soul quaked—he
raycalled the smile of Wurra-Wurra
to his face. ’Twas
none too soon, for Finola,
risen to her feet an’ leanin’
over, was pourin’ into the
idol’s ear all the grafe an’
dread that clutched her heart.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span>
From Finola’s lips the tale was like a white-hot
iron in Keth’s vitals. Yet it made his
heart swell an’ rache out to her so that he
could not restrain himsilf, but turned his head
an’ put his lips to hers in a kiss that dropped
her like wan dead at the idol’s feet.</p>

<p>Now Keth Mac Maragh knew what it was
for him to do, an’ he rayjoiced to do it
quickly. He came out from behind the
shattered idol, an’ lifted the limp form of
Finola in his arms, an’ bore her swiftly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span>
through the press of people
up to Patrick himsilf, an’
said:</p>

<p>“Good Patrick of Armagh,
this maid gave her
swate silf to me more suns
gone by than it pleases me
to raymimber. As thy faithful
follower, an’ for the
honor of thy household, I
pray you now give her to me
in the name of our Holy
Church an’ in the sight of
all min.”</p>

<p>An’ Patrick, seein’ how
the matter lay—Finola bein’
raycovered from her swoon
an’ clingin’ tight to Keth—thin<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span>
an’ there married an’

<p class="tb">’Tis towld in the books
how Keth became a bishop,
though niver would he altogether
lay aside the handstone
which had lain low
the last idol in Ireland, an’
how all the four fine sons
that Finola bore him were
sure death to snakes an’
Druid wizards till not wan
of ayther was lift in the
land.</p>

<p>Concernin’ the grotto, an’
the headless idol in it, all
there prisint bein’ now convertid<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span>
Christians, by their own free will they
prisintly destroyed ivery vistige of both.
Yet to this day there remains on the lips of
all the Irish race in time of trouble or worry
that same ancient invocation: “O Wurra-Wurra!”</p>

<p>An’ the ixplanation is Patrick’s own desire
that it should be so. For, as he raymarked
upon that occasion, Wurra-Wurra, as spoken
in the Gaelic, is the same as wan calling
upon the blissid Virgin, “O Mary!” in that
tongue.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Banba</span> (<a href="#Page_39">p. 39</a>): “Banba, the queen of one of the three
Dedannan princes, who ruled the land, sent a swarm
of meisa, or phantoms, which froze the blood of the
invaders (the Milesians) with terror.”—<i>Joyce’s
Social History of Ancient Ireland.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bog-cured Cheese</span> (<a href="#Page_72">p. 72</a>): “Masses of cheese have
been found in bogs, of which some specimens may
be seen in the National Museum.”—<i>Joyce’s Social
History.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Book of the Dun Cow</span> (<a href="#Page_14">p. 14</a>): “One of the most
ancient collections of Irish historical and legendary
material, curiously named for the color of the cow
in whose tanned skin it was bound.”—<i>Joyce.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Brehon Law</span> (<a href="#Page_44">p. 44</a>): “A judge was called a Brehon....
The Brehons had absolutely in their hands the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span>
interpretation of the laws and the application of
them to individual cases.”—<i>Joyce.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cromm Cruach</span> (<a href="#Page_11">p. 11</a>): “Cromm Cruach, covered
with gold and silver, and twelve other idols covered
with brass about him.”—<i>Tripartite Life of St.
Patrick.</i></p>

<p class="sub">“And the earth swallowed up the twelve other
images as far as their heads, and they stand thus in
token of the miracle.”—<i>Book of Armagh.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dedannan Furies</span> (<a href="#Page_22">p. 22</a>): “A mythical race of
powerful, demoniac and dangerous elves.”—<i>Joyce.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Demons</span>, <span class="smcap">Wizards</span>, <span class="smcap">Druids</span> (<a href="#Page_24">p. 24</a>): All the ancient
accounts agree that while the Druids were the only
educators in the Ireland of their time, they were also
magicians and wizards, and could command the services
of demons and fairies, good and bad.—<i>Tr.</i></p>

<p class="sub">“The demons used to show themselves unto their
worshippers in visible forms: they often attacked
the people, and they were seen flying in the air and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[87]</span>
walking on the earth, loathsome and horrible to
behold.”—<i>Joyce.</i></p>

<p class="sub">“God protect me from the spells of women
(Druidesses) and Smiths, and Druids.”—<i>St. Patrick’s
Hymn.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dubthach mac na Lugair</span> (<a href="#Page_42">p. 42</a>): Here the Legend
does not quite agree with the authorities. Instead
of being attached to the court of the King
of Connaught, he was royal poet and shanachy at
Tara during the greater part of Laeghaire’s reign
as Over-King of Ireland.—<i>Tr.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ethne the Fair, and Fedelm the Ruddy</span> (<a href="#Page_9">p. 9</a>):
In the “Tripartite Life of St. Patrick” and in the
“Book of Armagh,” these two daughters of King
Laeghaire are mentioned as being under the instruction
of the Druid priests, Caplait and Lucat-Moel,
at the time when Patrick overthrew Cromm Cruach
and the twelve smaller idols and made Christian
converts of the entire royal family.—<i>Tr.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Finola of the White Shoulder</span> (<a href="#Page_16">p. 16</a>): A heroine
of the “Book of Armagh.” Evidently the Legend
mistakes her for Cruimthiris, mentioned in the
“Tripartite Life” as one of the three embroideresses
in Patrick’s household.</p>

<p class="sub">(<a href="#Page_79">P. 79</a>): The reference to the four sons of Finola
of the White Shoulder is clearly legendary.—<i>Tr.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fasting to Collect a Debt</span> (<a href="#Page_42">p. 42</a>): “The plaintiff,
having served due notice, went to the house of the
defendant, and, sitting before the door, remained
there without food; and as long as he remained, the
defendant was also obliged to fast.”—<i>Joyce.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Geis</span> (<a href="#Page_62">p. 62</a>): “A geis was something forbidden. It
was believed to be very dangerous to disregard these
prohibitions.”—<i>Joyce.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Glanngalt</span> (<a href="#Page_48">p. 48</a>): “There is a valley in Kerry
called Glanngalt, the glen of the galts, or lunatics.”—<i>Joyce.</i></p>

<p class="sub">Here the Legend, by locating Glanngalt in Roscommon,
is palpably in error.—<i>Tr.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Handstone</span> (<a href="#Page_20">p. 20</a>): “It was the custom at that time,
every champion they killed in single combat, to take
the brains out of their heads and mix lime with
them till they were formed into hard balls.”—<i>Book
of Leinster.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Inns</span> (<a href="#Page_26">p. 26</a>): The hospitable custom of maintaining
inns for the free entertainment of travellers is mentioned
by nearly all authorities regarding the social
life of the ancient Irish. A most interesting account
is contained in “Joyce’s Social History.”—<i>Tr.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Laeghaire</span> (<a href="#Page_9">p. 9</a>): Modern form, Leary; he was the
Irish Over-King when Patrick landed at Wicklow
and began his missionary labors in Ireland, A.D.
432. All the characters in the Legend are historic,
and the names are spelled as originally derived from
the Gaelic.—<i>Tr.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mac Maragh, Keth</span> (<a href="#Page_14">p. 14</a>): Evidently confused
with Keth Magach, a famous warrior and champion
of that time, whose exploits are narrated in the
“Book of Armagh.”—<i>Tr.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Macc Cairthinn</span> (<a href="#Page_20">p. 20</a>): In the “Tripartite Life”
Macc Cairthinn is named as Patrick’s Strong Man.
Evidently the Legend confuses him with Keth
Magach.</p>

<p class="sub">(<a href="#Page_21">P. 21</a>): According to the “Tripartite Life,” it
was Patrick’s Strong Man, Macc Cairthinn, who
became a bishop, not Keth Magach.—<i>Tr.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Metheglin</span> (<a href="#Page_47">p. 47</a>): Also called mead, “was made
chiefly from honey: it was a drink in much request,
and was considered a delicacy.... It was slightly
intoxicating.”—<i>Joyce.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Population</span> (<a href="#Page_25">p. 25</a>): “For the people were very numerous
in Ireland at that time, and so great were
their numbers that the land could afford but thrice
nine ridges to each man in Erin: viz., nine of bog,
nine of field and nine of wood.”—<i>Book of Hymns
(Todd).</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Presbiter Bescna</span> (<a href="#Page_13">p. 13</a>): Named, with all the members
of Patrick’s household, in the “Tripartite
Life.”—<i>Tr.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Red Branch Knights</span> (<a href="#Page_20">p. 20</a>): According to Joyce
and other authorities, this was an order created by
Concobar Mac Nessa, a very ancient king of Ulster,
and whose greatest commander was Cuculainn, the
mightiest hero of Irish romance.—<i>Tr.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Shanachy</span> (<a href="#Page_26">p. 26</a>): “The people ... took delight in
listening to poetry, history and romantic stories,
recited by professional poets and shanachies.”—<i>Joyce.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Standards of Value</span> (<a href="#Page_44">p. 44</a>): As in many other countries
in ancient times, a cow, or an ox, was the
standard of value. It seems probable, therefore,
that the Legend is correct in using sheep, pigs and
geese for the “fractional currency” of the period.—<i>Tr.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Strong Man</span> (<a href="#Page_14">p. 14</a>): These Strong Men, or champions,
like the smiths and other metal-workers, appear
frequently in the old annals as distinguished
also for their knowledge of law and history, and for
their story-telling ability.—<i>Tr.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tara</span> (<a href="#Page_10">p. 10</a>): Seat of the Irish Over-Kings. Old
Erin’s centre of government, of learning and of
chivalry. Then, as now, the most eloquent of all
words descriptive of Ireland’s ancient glory. In
poetry, imperishable in the line: “The harp that once
thro’ Tara’s halls.” The scene of St. Patrick’s first
efforts to redeem Ireland from paganism.—<i>Tr.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tobernagalt</span> (<a href="#Page_48">p. 48</a>): “Drinking of the water of
Tobernagalt (the lunatics’ well), and eating of the
cresses that grew along the little stream, the poor
wanderers get restored to sanity.... There is a
well called Stroove Bran, which was thought to possess
the same virtue as Tobernagalt.”—<i>Joyce.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wurra-Wurra</span> (<a href="#Page_18">p. 18</a>): The authorities do not specifically
mention the existence of an idol having that
name; but they agree that idols were worshipped in
all parts of ancient Ireland.—<i>Tr.</i></p>

<p class="sub">The Irish up to that time (St. Patrick’s) “had
worshipped only idols and abominations.”—<i>St. Patrick’s
Confession.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span></p>

<p class="sub">“The destruction of idols in various parts of the
country was an important part of St. Patrick’s lifework.”—<i>Joyce.</i></p>

<p class="sub">(<a href="#Page_80">P. 80</a>): Some Gaelic scholars hold that the familiar
exclamation, “Wurra-wurra!” is the nearest
approach in that tongue to the conventional invocation
of the Blessed Virgin. The Legend, however,
makes it, in that sense, an adaptation—evidently
intending a tribute to St. Patrick’s well-known
policy of harmonizing his teachings, as far
as possible at the start, with ancient customs and
beliefs.—<i>Tr.</i></p>
